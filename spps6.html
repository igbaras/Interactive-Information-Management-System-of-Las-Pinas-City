							<h1>Manpower Training Development and Employment</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="./Assets/programservicesassets/images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>To ensure that Las Piñas residents are provided with employable skills, manpower training programs have been undertaken by the Aguilar administration since 1995.

								Manpower training and livelihood centers and its satellite offices in the barangays benefit more than 2,000 members every year. There are a variety of training courses to choose from: electronics, dressmaking and tailoring, stuffed-toy making, driving, radio-TV repair, computer education and other entrepreneurial skills.</p>
								<p>The strengthening of Public Employment Services Offices (PESO) for employment referrals and job fairs ensures that skills that are learned are put to good use through and that the students are gainfully employed after graduation.</p>
